## Display Dimensions

### Minimum Display Dimensions

A 150px by 100px photo has little impact and conveys minimal
information. Photos should always be displayed with dimensions
of at least **225px by 150px** for teasers or previews, such as
those used in lists of news stories, and at least **300px by
200px** when used in a page’s main content, as those same news
story photos would be in each story’s full page view.
