## Image Scheme

### Hero Imagery

#### Usage
Hero images help draw attention, provide context about content, or reinforce the brand.

#### Placement
They are anchored in the most prominent position, such as the top of the screen.

##### Choosing a hero image

Hero images should make an impact, engaging the user and setting
the emotional tone for the page, but they shouldn’t overpower
the content elements they support (navbar, headings, etc.)  When
selecting a hero image for a page, pay attention to both the
appearance of the image and its composition.

##### Appearance

When considering the appearance of a hero image, follow our
exisiting brand guidelines:

> All photography should feel cinematic, allowing each photo
> to tell its own story. Each image should have a single focus,
> using people as the primary subject as much as possible.

> Equipment such as ships and other craft may also be used as the
> primary subject.

> Some colors don't pair well with our brand colors. Avoid images
> with large areas of clashing color.

##### Composition

When considering the composition of a prospective hero image,
avoid images with focal areas in the top third or left third of
the image. These areas should be reserved for the page header
and featured content headings, respectively.

Thumbnails are small images that represent the narrative or information in tight spaces. They typically act as tap targets that lead to primary content, appearing within components.
